<h1>Research Portfolio</h1>
<p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher, studying trace gas emissions relevant
to air quality and climate change. My work focuses on developing emission monitoring
methods to provide localized information with lower uncertainties and/or higher temporal
resolution than traditionally available. Observational data are used from instrumented
unmanned aerial systems, monitoring stations, and satellite remote sensing, applied to
areas such as livestock agriculture and natural gas infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
<a name="RP_methane"></a><h3>Methane from wetlands using sUAS</h3></a>
<p>Wetlands are the single largest source of methane to the atmosphere. Northern wetlands can be very heterogeneous and are often measured at the site-level with flux chambers or towers. Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) typically operate at similar spatial scale but can provide more sampling flexibility. Research is ongoing with USGS Menlo Park, leveraging miniaturized methane and wind sensors, to demonstrate this approach in Alaska.</p>

<a name="RP_Kilauea"></a><h3>Air quality during the 2018 Kilauea eruption</h3></a>
<p>In 2018, Kilauea volcano in Hawaii erupted with significantly increased emissions of SO2, in addition to lava hazards in the east rift zone. I am working with Princeton University using satellite, ground monitors, and dispersion modeling to better characterize emissions and air quality impacts to populated areas of Hawaii during this event.</p>

<a name="RP_airborne"></a><h3>Airborne science instrumentation</h3></a>
<p>Laser-based instrumentation are capable of providing fast and precise measurements well suited to airborne science campaigns. Two separate instruments measuring carbon monoxide and carbonyl sulfide are being tested at NASA and modified for better stability in the lab and in dynamic flight conditions over a range of temperatures and pressures. Potential flight campaigns are expected in 2021.</p>
